# Audio Data Science Project:
# Audible Hazard Detection


## What is the Project about?
Building an AI for sonic recognition of dangers/treats and signal tones in daily sounds (e.g. fire alarm, vehicle sirence or car horns).<br />
Reason behind the idea: Hearing-impaired or deaf people make around 5% of the worlds population. Whereas, for using an AI in this field, the research and application possibilities are significantly small.<br />
Using this CNN as the base for an application, affected people could be instantly warned of dangers through the vibrations of a smartphone.<br />
Project goal: Being able to detect sounds that could be or lead to a serious threat.
